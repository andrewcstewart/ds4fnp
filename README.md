# Data Stacks For Fun & Noneprofits!

Data Stacks For Fun & Nonprofits is a series of articles and tutorials aimed towards designing and implementing a modern data stack using open source and open core components.  The DS4FNP stack is intended to be accessible enough for education purposes (both in terms of costs and laptop-deployable), but suitably scalable as a mature analytics architecture for organizations of all sizes.

## Getting started
